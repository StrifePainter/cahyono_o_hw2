            <h2 class="lb-heading">Fribbit von Hoppenshire</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Fribbit comes from a Grippli tribe in a mgaical forest. When his home burned from raiders, he alone goes out to find his place in the world. His love of bees ends up placing in a cult of beekeepers, which he ultimately left when he found out that they were sacrificing people and turning blood into honey. Fribbit wanders the earth building beehives and doing good by nature to someday fill his heart with his longing for a family. He meets the group of adventurers when scavenging the lair of the deceased hag-dragon they defeated and is happily integrated into his new found family. </p>
            <p class="lb-text">His child like demeanor makes him curious about all life, always investigating about what he could know and making every plan to look out for his group. Although the Grippli species in nature are more patient, Fribbit is quite opposed to it due to his age (just turned into a young adult, but in human years he's 12 years old).But he can be impulsive once in a while, like summoning a frost drake in a 10 foot wide hallway that's on fire (which he totally did not set on fire) with 10 assassins and his party members.<br>
            Fribbit is very group orientated, given his background with his tribe and cult. Although he bases his decisions on the group, Fribbit is always making plans and will occassionaly gain the courage to enact his own actions.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Orion the Storm Elf</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Orion Evaron hails from the Deadbrine Archipelago, the adopted son of Adelaide and Del'akshi Evaron now finds himself far from home in the far northern reaches of the world. Orion was found by his parents in a small alcove near a beach on their now home of Splintered Hull island. With him they found both a book in an undecipherable language and bronze ornate armor whose origin neither could determine. The newborn was himself adorned in blue skin decorated by strange ornate white tattoos matching the color of his hair, neither of which were commonplace for any elf they had known or seen, in fact the only thing they could decipher was that he held the features of an elf and was a boy. They waited for several weeks keeping an eye out for anyone that might be looking for him, but as the weeks turned into months they decided to adopt him and brought him into their little family fully.</p> 

            <p class="lb-text"></p>Growing up Orion felt a bit like an outcast, being an elf certainly helped in a place like Dryatir, however being blue and covered in strange markings did not. Even with this lack of interaction with peers, he supplemented with interactions of the natural world. Whether this inclination was due to his personality or something else is uncertain, his connection nonetheless grew with time. This connection would capture the attention of a Sea Leshy by the name of Braan who would over time teach the young Orion of the natural magics of the world, even if these teachings were sporadic due to Braan's wandering nature and certainly unconventional. These teachings would eventually lead Orion to become a fully fledged Druid, even if his training was anything but traditional, his own personal connection to the natural world stirred and grew within in during this time, much to Braan's own curiosity.</p>

            <p class="lb-text">Perhaps it was his time spent with Braan talking about his travels, or perhaps there was always a part of him that longed to know, but after seeing runes similar to his own in a book he set out in search of answers as to his origins leaving a letter with his parents to explain his sudden disappearance. On the search for Sebastian Capote he learned many different life lessons, how not to be overly polite, the rush of fighting for your life, and the struggle with grief when friend pass. Eventually finding the author he was pointed to the far North in the direction of Kro, and now seeks answers at the roof of the world.</p>
